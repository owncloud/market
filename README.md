## About the ownCloud OSPO

The [Kiteworks Open Source Program Office](https://kiteworks.com/opensource), operating under
the [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com) brand, launched on May 5, 2026, to steward the open source
ecosystem around ownCloud's products. The OSPO ensures transparent governance, license compliance,
community health, and sustainable collaboration between the open source community and
[Kiteworks](https://www.kiteworks.com), which acquired ownCloud in 2023.

### License Migration to Apache 2.0

The OSPO is driving a strategic relicensing of ownCloud repositories toward the
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), following
the [Apache Software Foundation's third-party license policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html).

Individual repositories will migrate as their audit is completed. The LICENSE file
in each repo reflects its **current** license status (not the target).

**Current license: AGPL-3.0** (Category X per Apache policy -- cannot be included in Apache-2.0 works).

Migration prerequisites for this repository:

- **CLA/DCO coverage**: All past contributors must have signed agreements permitting relicensing
- **Copyleft dependency audit**: All AGPL/GPL dependencies must be replaced or isolated
- **KDE heritage review**: Any code with KDE-era copyrights requires legal analysis
- **Complete relicensing**: AGPL-3.0 is a strong copyleft license; migration requires full relicensing of all files, not just a header change
